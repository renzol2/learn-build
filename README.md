# [Learn Build](https://learn-build.vercel.app/). Self-teaching done right.
### First, some questions
How do we learn new things? As students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, we all have at least one thing in common: we're paying tens of thousands
of dollars for a college education. But what about everyone else? What about people
trying to self-teach for entry level IT jobs? Or people with a degree in business
looking to change career paths? **Or, maybe even more importantly, what about people
who simply can't afford the price tag of a college degree?**

### The problem
Take Sally for example. Sally wants to start learning about web development, so
she googles "intro to web dev." What she gets back is pages and pages of resources
to look at, but now she has no idea where to start. If she wants guidance on where
to begin, she might consult random users on reddit or an obscure forum, but for the
most part she comes to realize that there's an over saturation of options with no
clear direction. **That's where Learn Build comes in.**

### The solution
**Learn Build is a crowdsourcing platform for building the best way to learn.** It
allows users to create, find, and view Builds containing free resources they've
found helpful for learning about certain topics at an intro, intermediate, and advanced
level. Tags filter Builds into relevant categories and allow users to easily
start finding resources for topics that interest them. And an upvote system highlights
Builds that others have used to succeed.

### About us
Our mission is to give control back to the user when it comes to deciding how they
want to learn. **Through Learn Build, we hope to foster a community for learning and
sharing open and accessible to everyone.**
